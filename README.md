#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in information and communication sciences in the [IMSIC laboratory](https://www.imsic.fr/) at the [UniversitÃ© de Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/), France. You can find a short resume on [my personal homepage](https://altab.fr).

I am currently working on various projects around open science and more precisely around the [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/) open archive. I also give courses in the [Master Information et Communication, data analytics and information strategy](http://www.ingemedia.net/formations/master-data-analytics-strategie-information) at the [UniversitÃ© de Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/).
